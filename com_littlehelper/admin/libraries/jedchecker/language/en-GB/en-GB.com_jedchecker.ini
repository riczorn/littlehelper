COM_JEDCHECKER_CONGRATS="Congratulations! If you use this component then you've most probably developed a Joomla!Â® extension! Now comes the &quot;hard&quot; part - getting it listed in the Joomla Extension Directory (JED). The JED has strict requirements to the extensions that get listed there. Those requirements can be found <a href='%s' target='_blank'>here</a>. Currently extensions are being manually tested for code problems. This component is an attempt to simplify your and the JED editors life's by automatically checking the code for common errors in extensions."
COM_JEDCHECKER_CODE_STANDARDS="However our goal is not only to test the extensions against common code errors that prevent it from getting listed in the JED. Our goal is to also have code standards checks such as the <a href='%s' target='_blank'>JPlatform has</a>. This would ensure that joomla extension developers are aware of the JPlatform coding standards and this could raise the quality bar in our Joomla community even higher! For this we will need you! Have a look at the <a href='%s' target='_blank'>github project page</a>. Fork the component! Add your code checks and send us your pull requests!"

COM_JEDCHECKER_RULE_PH2="PHP Files missing JEXEC security"
COM_JEDCHECKER_RULE_PH2_DESC="All the PHP files in your extension needs to have a defined('_JEXEC') or die(); statement in the beginning of each file. This ensures that the file cannot be opened outside of the joomla installation and this way increases the security of your site."
COM_JEDCHECKER_RULE_PH3="License tag missing or incorrect in XML install file"

COM_JEDCHECKER_ERROR_ENCODING="You've used encoding in this file? This is not an error, but an editor will have to review this file!"
COM_JEDCHECKER_RULE_ENCODING="Base64 or other type of encoding in the files"
COM_JEDCHECKER_RULE_ENCODING_DESC="As developers we are fully aware that the base64 and similar functions have a valid place in each extensions(like URL redirects or data storage). However if you use those to make it harder for users to read your code or to mask backlinks the JED might not accept your listing submission (this is not in the spirit of GPL anyway!). An editor will review your code and determine if the way you use the base64 matches the rules of the JED. This might slow your listing review time. So the rule of thumb is - don't do fishy stuff and avoid encoding your code if possible!"
COM_JEDCHECKER_ERROR_ERRORREPORTING="You've used error_reporting(0) in this file."
COM_JEDCHECKER_RULE_ERRORREPORTING="error_reporting(0) in the files"
COM_JEDCHECKER_RULE_ERRORREPORTING_DESC="Using error_reporting(0) is discouraged as Joomla provides an error_reporting option in the Global Configuration. Currently your extensions will be published on the JED if you have this in your files, but this might change in the future! So better don't use this to disable the error reporting."
